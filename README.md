# CarsDatapy
This Python program is designed to manage car information through a list and dictionary.
it includes functions to load car data from a file, filter cars by make and color, sort the cars by year, remove a car by it's
ID, and print the count of cars for each make. The test script (test.py) demonstrates the program's functionality with sample data. 
The car_data file contains car details, and the test script showcases operations like loading data, filtering by make and color, and
removing a car from the dictionary. The results are written to a new file. Together, these components provide a convenient way 
to interact with and manipulate car data in various ways.
